# 🌦️ Weather Forecast App 🌦️

## Overview 🌟
Welcome to the Weather Forecast App project! 🚀 Build a dynamic weather dashboard that provides users with up-to-date weather information for multiple cities. This app will allow users to plan their trips effectively by presenting the current and future weather conditions. Utilize the 5 Day Weather Forecast API to retrieve weather data, and leverage localStorage to store persistent data.

## User Story ✨

When a user views the current weather conditions for a city, they are presented with:
- The city name
- The date
- An icon representation of weather conditions

- The humidity
- The wind speed
When a user views future weather conditions for a city, they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
